Canada's federal and Quebec governments have bowed to the commercial and
political costs of rampant cigarette smuggling across the US-Canada border
and look set to reverse a tradition of ever-higher taxation on tobacco
products.
Both Quebec and Ottawa have promised to cut and perhaps even abolish the
high federal and provincial taxes which are widely blamed for the surge in
cigarette smuggling.
The problem is most acute in Quebec, where the Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers Council estimates that about two-thirds of all cigarette sales
are contraband.
A group of Quebec convenience store owners, whose business has been ravaged
by smuggling, earlier this week flouted the law by setting up an illegal
market north of Montreal, where they sold cigarettes at the smuggled price
of CDollars 20 (Pounds 10.20) a carton, compared with the fully-taxed retail
price of CDollars 40-CDollars 46.
Governments have become increasingly concerned at the social and political
ramifications of smuggling. Much of the trade, which is centred on the St
Lawrence River and Indian reserves which straddle the US-Canada border, has
fallen into the hands of organised crime.
Some Indian communities have begun to manufacture their own cigarettes, and
contraband products are starting to find their way on to retailers' shelves
in counterfeit packaging.
The ready availability of cheap, smuggled cigarettes is also believed to
have boosted consumption. Contraband packs carry less prominent health
warnings.
Ottawa and the provinces have so far failed to agree on a co-ordinated tax
cut. Ontario, which collects CDollars 800m a year from tobacco taxes and is
struggling to contain a yawning budget deficit, is reluctant to forfeit a
sizeable source of revenue.
But the smuggling issue has gained a political dimension in Quebec, where
separatists argue that the francophone province could easily put a stop to
the trade if it had greater autonomy from Ottawa.
Tobacco manufacturers estimate that taxes on cigarettes will have to be
chopped by about two-thirds to compete with contraband goods.
They are also banking on a rise in US cigarette taxes within the next year
to narrow the price gap between the two countries.
