Narcotics make for a black economy half that of the official one

WHEN drug dealers operating in the Khyber Pass felt threatened by a
Pakistani government road-building scheme earlier this year, they attacked
the construction crews with machine-guns, mortars and a heat-seeking
missile.
Nine men were killed in the raids which were meant to prevent the government
from bringing an all-weather road to the remote Tirah Valley, the home of
poppy fields and scores of heroin laboratories.
Officials have stopped the building work while they try to persuade local
village chiefs to guarantee the workmen safe passage.
The tribesmen of the Khyber Pass have never taken kindly to outsiders on
their territory, as the British colonial rulers discovered a century ago.
But today the weaponry at their disposal enables them to project their power
beyond the mountains lying on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
While the poppies are mostly grown on the Afghan side of the border, the
profits accrue to dealers who are mainly Pakistanis. Their fortress-like
homes dot the road along the Khyber Pass. Outside there are watchtowers;
inside, opulent houses decked in marble.
The dealers' influence reaches into Afghanistan through the guerrilla
commanders who need drugs money for buying arms and ammunition. It also
penetrates far into Pakistan, distorting the country's economy and politics.
The shock of violent incidents such as the Tirah road attacks, the swelling
population of drug addicts in Pakistan and strong pressure from the US and
other developed countries is at last forcing some officials to admit to the
scale of the drug lords' influence.
At a recent UN-sponsored drug abuse conference in Islamabad delegates from
Pakistan concluded: 'The massive inflows of money financed by drugs have
given birth to a new political situation in Pakistan. . . . The profits
generated from illicit narcotics activity have contributed to a huge black
economy, half the size of the official one.'
Poppies have been grown in Afghanistan for centuries, but never in the past
on a large scale. The tribesmen preferred marijuana, and heroin was
virtually unknown until the advent of war in Afghanistan in 1979.
But in the last decade a region which encompasses eastern Iran, Afghanistan
and Pakistan has become the world's second largest producer of illegal opium
with an estimated 1,115 tonnes last year, mostly in Afghanistan, according
to US government figures. This is well short of the 2,500 tonnes produced in
south-east Asia, including Burma's Golden Triangle. But south-east Asian
output is falling, albeit slightly: Afghan farmers are rapidly increasing
their production. This year's crop is estimated to be 20 to 50 per cent
higher than 1992's.
The initial stimulus for increasing output came from a crackdown on
opium-growing in Middle Eastern countries, including Turkey and Iran. The
war in Afghanistan then prompted anti-Soviet mujahideen guerrillas to raise
production and to invest in heroin laboratories to increase their revenues
to buy arms. The fight against communism was seen as so important that
officials in Pakistan, from where many mujahideen were supplied, turned a
blind eye to the proliferation of heroin.
Despite the Soviet withdrawal, the mujahideen groups still need money
because they are now fighting each other. Elsewhere in the country, peace
has permitted farmers to go back into their war-ravaged fields.
Mr Habimullah Khan, a farmer in eastern Afghanistan, says villagers have no
choice about growing poppies since they bring ten times as much money as
other crops. 'This year we planted more poppies than before. Next year we
will plant even more,' he says.
Moreover, the collapse of the Soviet Union has eased the drug smugglers'
transport problem. The traditional route has been south through Pakistan to
the port city of Karachi and from there by air and by boat to the rest of
the world. But the borders of the former Soviet republics in central Asia
have opened up to trade - so trucks laden with legitimate goods such as
dried fruit are being used to smuggle heroin into Russia and from Russia
into western Europe.
Dealers in the tribal areas lying on the border with Afghanistan dominate
the trade. Under agreements dating back to Pakistan's birth as an
independent state in 1947, the government's writ does not run in the tribal
areas. Instead, they are administered by tribal chiefs, who choose which
laws, if any, they will apply.
Plentiful handouts from the drug dealers ensure that anti-narcotics laws are
enforced weakly, if at all. Mr Altaf Gauhar, editor of the Muslim, a leading
Pakistani newspaper, alleges that almost all the politicians representing
the tribal areas in the national assembly in Islamabad are drug smugglers.
A frequent target of such accusations is Mr Haji Ayub Afridi, a former truck
driver turned millionaire businessman and politician who owns the largest of
the forts on the Khyber Pass. Mr Afridi's house was raided two years ago in
the course of a drugs investigation. But neither then nor later was any
evidence found linking him to narcotics smuggling. He denies any involvement
in the trade.
A study commissioned by the US Central Intelligence Agency this year found
that heroin trading had penetrated 'the highest political circles' in
Islamabad and named as a suspected drug smuggler Mr Sohail Zia Butt, a
brother-in-law of the prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif.
Alleged dealers are also active at the top of the business community in
Karachi. There are many suspected top drug dealers in investigators' files
but officials cannot act for lack of firm evidence. Western anti-drugs
experts retort that evidence is lacking because of the drug lords' political
protection. 'They are allowed to work behind screens,' said one.
Mr Ralph Seccombe, Pakistan field adviser for the United Nations drug
control programme, says the whole country is already paying the price for
permitting drug dealers to flourish. 'Pakistan has over 1m addicts. That's
6m people who are affected if you include their families. But it's 100m who
are suffering from the political and economic consequences.'
