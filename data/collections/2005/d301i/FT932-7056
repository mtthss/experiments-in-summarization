FT  26 MAY 93 / Drugs war hits home in Mexico: Bloody shooting of a cardinal
highlights growing problem

THE killing on Monday of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo of Guadalajara
appears to be the latest and, for many, the most shocking development in
Mexico's drugs war.
The Roman Catholic cardinal and six other people died in the airport carpark
of Guadalajara, Mexico's second city. Officials said they thought they died
in crossfire during a shoot-out involving suspected drugs traffickers. Two
men have been detained by the Mexican police.
Cardinal Posadas, who was 66, had been cardinal in Guadalajara for nearly
two years, and had previously served as bishop in the cities of Tijuana and
Cuernavaca. Masses in his honour were being held throughout the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country yesterday.
While drug-related violence is usually concentrated in a few towns in the
north of Mexico, where the cartels reside, the number of such killings has
been increasing and has exposed Mexico to criticism from US drug-enforcement
authorities, who point to official corruption that allows traffickers to
flourish. Between 50 and 70 per cent of US-bound cocaine is shipped through
Mexico.
In November last year, in perhaps the most notorious recent incident, at
least a dozen men with machine guns shot dead six drug traffickers in a
discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, a holiday resort on the Pacific coast, near
Guadalajara. In January this year a vicious clan war broke out in Culiacan,
Sinoloa, Mexico's drug capital, as more than 60 people were murdered in 20
days, including eight in a public shoot-out in the central square.
On April 11 the drug fight reached the holiday resort of Cancun, on the
Caribbean coast, when six armed menkilled Rafael Aguilar Guajardo, a drug
trafficker from the cartel of Ciudad Juarez, and an American tourist.
On May 1, in what was described as a government triumph, the chief of the
Guadalajara cartel, Emilio Quintero Payan, was gunned down by police outside
a shopping centre.
The drug problem could yet cause difficulties for Mexico in the run-up to
the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Until now, most of the debate over Nafta has focused on US job losses and
Mexico's lax enforcement of environmental and labour laws. But this week the
New York Times gave extensive coverage to a report from a US intelligence
officer that warned Mexican drug-traffickers were planning to take advantage
of lax border controls.
Drug-traffickers were planning to purchase trucking and warehouse businesses
along the border, and had started buying in-bond plants as conduits for drug
shipments.
Under international and domestic pressure, President Carlos Salinas in
January this year replaced an ineffective attorney-general with Mr Jorge
Carpizo, former head of the National Human Rights Commission, and a man
known for his aversion to corruption.
Mr Carpizo soon announced that some 200 anti-drug agents (of a total of
about 2,000) were being investigated for links to the drug-traffickers, and
issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Guillermo Gonzalez Calderoni, former
head of the drug investigations in the attorney-general's office, for
'inexplicable enrichment'.
A judge has also been accused of conspiring with drug-traffickers by
refusing to issue warrants for arrest of 19 suspected cocaine smugglers.
